## Optimizations and Improvements

### Performance Enhancements
- **Code Splitting**: Implemented lazy loading for route components to reduce initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Added image optimization utilities for better loading performance and reduced bandwidth usage
- **Removed Fancy Animations**: Simplified CSS by removing resource-intensive animations and effects
- **Memoization**: Used React's useMemo for expensive computations to avoid unnecessary recalculations
- **Query Client Configuration**: Optimized React Query configuration with proper caching and stale time settings

### Error Handling Improvements
- **Error Boundary**: Added a global error boundary to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully
- **Network Status Monitoring**: Implemented a network status hook to handle offline scenarios
- **Fallback UI Components**: Created skeleton loaders and empty states for better loading and error experiences
- **Improved Error Feedback**: Enhanced error messages and notifications with proper context

### Code Architecture
- **Context Separation**: Split the large AppContext into smaller, more focused contexts (UserProfile, Job)
- **Custom Hooks**: Created reusable hooks for common operations like data fetching
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript types and interfaces for better type checking
- **Memory Management**: Added proper cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **More Professional Design**: Reduced "gimmicky" elements for a cleaner, more professional appearance
- **Responsive Improvements**: Better handling of different screen sizes and orientations
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance Perception**: Added skeleton loaders and visual feedback for asynchronous operations

### Component Improvements
- **Optimized Image Component**: Created a performance-optimized image component with lazy loading and blur-up effect
- **Enhanced Avatar Component**: Improved avatar with better fallbacks and image optimization
- **Error States**: Added proper empty states and error handling for all components

These optimizations have significantly improved the application's performance, reliability, and user experience while maintaining all functionality.
